Project Description
This project aims to study marital age in different countries. It does so by studying the relationship between marital age for females and different economic and social factors. The aim of this project is to see if the average age of when females get married in a country has an effect on or affected by other important socioeconomic variables like GDP, female unemployment, and female education. The data we have was obtained from the World Bank's website: https://data.worldbank.org/. The data is specific for the year 2011 as it is the most recent year with sufficient data. We use graphs and maps to present the results of thi data as well as some statistical measurement. Our data suggests a positive correlation between marital age and GDP and Female students, but a negative correlation between marital age and unemployed females. However, it also shows a weak correlation so the results are not reliable. Throughout this project, there will be some comentaries to further elaborate results and explain the process.
