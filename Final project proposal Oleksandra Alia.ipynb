    "The goal is not just to find the relationship between education and marriage for females but also other circumstances that surround such relationship. That is because, while there might be a correlation between the first two variables, the other variables may have impact as well. The data for those variables has been collected from the World Bank site.\n",
    "An expected correlation is that the higher percentage of female enrollment in secondary education, the lower percentage of those married by the age of 18. This hypothesis is based of our belief that when female education is endorsed within a community, girls have more opportunities and pursue their careers then decide on marriage later in their lives. However, an article posted two months ago by The Atlantic had the headline “The More Gender Equality, The Fewer Women in STEM” showed that women in countries where there is oppression or relatively less gender equality pursue a career in STEM -science, technology, engineering, and math- more than those in countries with relatively higher gender equality. One explanation was that these women in the oppressed countries have the urge to rebel or prove themselves so they pursue the unconventional whereas those who live in more liberal countries do not view it as challenging. This interesting perspective only made us more determinant to carry our test and see what results we’ll get."

    "Initially, the main ways in which we are planning on presenting our data is through line graphs, bar graphs and maps. The graphs are for quick presentation of the trend whereas the map would be for further quantifying and grouping the values while locating them on maps to be able to assess the countries or areas with common features and trends. We intend to make graphs and charts using data for two time periods: 2006 and 2016 in order to observe the differences and patterns across time. It is within our expectations to see that the overall age of marriage is increasing over time due to social, economic, and cultural changes in the world. Moreover, it would be interesting to observe whether the relationship between variables across time is stronger or weaker between the groups of countries, which we expect to demonstrate on a map where the variables will correlate with the intensity of color across countries. We would categorize the countries by their level of GDP and create graphs that would take a closer look at countries with high, medium and low GDP. In addition to that, we will create closer look graphs that will demonstrate a relationship between countries in one geographic region (Latin America, Middle East, Europe, etc.). That will allow us to observe the variation and differences on a smaller scale. \n"
